[Only educational porpouses software]
This is the second version of Health Profile Reader and Writter

Changes made:
- The interactive part was removed
- The build.xml has a new feature added (execute.evaluation), that execute automatically the required procedures

During load the program works with marshall and unmarchall procedures

In order to try it you need to have ant installed, clone it to your machine, go to the main folder and type the following instructions

ant compile
ant execute.evaluation

In case you want to try the old interactive version of the reader, go to the HealthProfileReader.java, comment the executions and uncomment the switch case instructions.
